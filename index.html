      <p style="font-size:17px"> Listen, if you're on the "Pete Davidson is ugly" side of the argument you're not alone. So is every
      insecure straight man in the comment section of his videos. They can't fathom that a skinny, awkward, self deprecating guy like
      Pete could ever be attractive. It scares them. It enrages them. But honestly, what's not to like about him? There's just something
      about the audacious bleached hair, the bags under his eyes, the angle his spine hunches at (has anybody measured?), and the way the
      sleeves of his shirts never touch his wrists because his arms are too long. The man cleans up nicely. In "Dressing Funny" by Netflix is a Joke
      (France, 2019), professional fashionista Tan France states that Pete Davidson has BDE which is fact backed by research (Grande, 2019).
      Also, he served a look in a crisp white turtleneck and tan suit, that hung off his wiry frame in a surprisingly elegant way.

      <p style="font-size:17px"> This man literally walked a runway for Alexander Wang and you know what? He looked like he belonged there.

      those whose appearance carries a very strong personality, and whether you love it or hate it, you can't deny that Pete Davidson's look says everything
      you need to know about him. And yes, I know his tattoos are terrible. But they look good on him, somehow.</p>
